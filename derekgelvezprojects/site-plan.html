      <p>
        <h4>Introduction and Purpose</h4>
        <p>This Website serves as a professional digital portfolio that highlights
        my personal and academic jounrey in th efield of technology and develpoment. 
        It is designed not only to showcase what I've accomplished so far but also
        to demonstrate how I apply what I learn to real-world projects. By creating this site, 
        I also am demonstrating what I have learned during the semester regarding web
        development, content organization, and perosnal branding-which are skills  that
        are needed in the job market</p>
        <h4>Target Audience</h4>
        <p>The primary audieence for this website are recruiters and hiring managers
          who are looking to see my technical skills and project experience.
        </p>
        <h4>Why People Will Visit</h4>
        <p>People will ocme to this website to evaluate my qualifications, learn about my 
          technical abilites, and see real exampels of how I've applied what I've learned.
          Recruiters and hiring managers will visit to determine if my skills would be applicable
          to the real world.
        </p>
        <h4>Questions Visitors Will Want Answered</h4>
        <p>Visitors will want to know:What coding languages do I know? What kind of projects have I 
          worked on? What role did I play in each project? Do I have the experience they're looking
          for a candidate or collaborator? They may also be interested in how I think, Solve 
          problems, and communicate - things they can infer from my writing and code samples
        </p>

      </ul>
      <h3>Projects</h3>
      <p>
        <h4>Project Showcase Overview</h4>
        <p>This section of the website will feature a collection of my projects, categorized by 
          type (personal, academic, or collaborative). Each project will have a dedicated summary
          page with screenshots, code snippets, and the outcome. This helps visitors assess my experience and 
          approach to problem-solving.
          <h4>Skill Highlights and Tools</h4>
          <p>Visitors to this child page will see a breakdown of the techincal skills I've developed, such
            as programming languages, frameworks, databses, and development tools. These will be presented
            with short explinations and links to projects where each skill was applied. This structure 
            allows recruiters to confirm whether I match the skill set required for specific roles
            <h4>Learning in Action</h4>
            <p>I want to emphasize that I am a continous learner. This paragraph will describe 
              how I tackle new concepts, and work through challenges in a project. I'll share exampels
              where learning a new coding langauge helped me grow as a developer. This shows not just what I know,
              but how I learn and adapt.
              <h4>Project Navigation and Interactivity</h4>
              <p>Each project entry will offer links to the live project (if available), Github, and written documentation.
                This way, visitors can choose to explore my work in the way that suites them-quick overviews or deep dives.
                The design will support skimming as well as detailed browsing

      </ul>
      <h3>Resume & Contact</h3>
      <p>
        <h4>Resume Access</h4>
        <p>This page will feature a downloadable PDF of my resume as well as an
          HTML version for easy viewing. It will be kept updated regularly. Key areas of the resume
          -like education, experience, and certifications-will be emphasized visually to help recruiters find
          what they need quickly
          <h4>Contact & Networking</h4>
          <p>Visitors will find ways to contact me: an embedded contact form,  email link,
            and links to my Github. A simple, clean layout will ensure that reaching out is 
            easy. I want to create a low-friction path for someone to connect with me
          <h4>Why This Site Instead of Another?</h4>
          <p>Every piece of content is personalized and reflective of who I am as a developer.
            Instead of just listing skills and titles, I show how I use them and what I've learned. 
            It's meant to make a strong impression.

      <h3>Home</h3>
      <p>         
        I want this page to have a parallax effect, So the header and the img will go down as the person scrolls down and then the about me will be shown. When the page is first opened there will be a "welcome" or something

        I know the headshot I have submited is not the most professional, but I literally do not have a better image. But it's pretty straight forward, Ill have the headshot in a circle overlapping the other image which i want to make the opactiy less. And on the right side will be my resume
