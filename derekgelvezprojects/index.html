                <p>Hi there, and welcome to my personal portfolio website!</p>
                <p>This site is a curated collection of my work—both academic and personal—that showcases my growth, skills, and passion for technology and development. Whether you're a recruiter, hiring manager, or just someone curious about what I’ve been working on, I’m glad you stopped by.</p>
                <p>Here, you’ll find a selection of projects that demonstrate how I apply what I’ve learned in class to real-world challenges. Each project includes context, tools used, and what I learned along the way. I’ve also included a breakdown of my technical skills and a resume that you can view or download.</p>
                <p>Thanks for visiting—I hope you find something here that sparks your interest! If you have any questions, want to collaborate, or just want to connect, feel free to reach out through the contact page.</p>
